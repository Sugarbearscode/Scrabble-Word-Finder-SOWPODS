# Scrabble-Word-Finder-SOWPODS

this is a little project I made to produce a totally standalone HTML and javascript web page that would allow
you to search for scrabble words to confirm if they were valid. 

Simple and easy, just make sure you have javascript turned on in your web browser and it should work. 

it will validate words between 2 and 15 characters in length
it removes spaces if they are entered 
Upper/lower case is ignored as well. 

Get scrabbling !!
